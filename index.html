  Swimming has always been one of my favorite things to do during the summer. It feels so awesome to dive into a chilly pool, and it gives me an escape from the heat of summer.

<h2 class="home-h2">‚ù§2. Playing with my puppy outside</h2>

<p>
  I love playing with my puppy outside. It's super fun to hang out with him and play games like fetch. We both enjoy being able to run around outside together and not just stay inside the entire time. I have lots of fun whenever I get the time to take my puppy outside to play!

<h2 class="home-h2">‚ù§3. Eating Ice Cream</h2>
<p>
  Another one of my favorite things is eating ice cream. Chocolate, strawberry, vanilla, mint chocolate chip, whatever is your favorite flavor, the sweet and cold taste of ice cream can never be beat during the summer.
